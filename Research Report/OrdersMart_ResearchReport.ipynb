    "__üìòResearch Report,  Project : Analytical Orders Mart with dbt & Snowflake.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Project Overview__ : The Analytical Orders Mart with dbt & Snowflake project demonstrates the end-to-end design and implementation of a modern analytical data pipeline. The objective was to build a scalable, reliable, and analytics-ready Orders Mart that transforms raw transactional data into structured fact and dimension models, enabling downstream business intelligence and reporting. 'This project is an end-to-end data warehouse pipeline. We loaded raw CSVs into Snowflake, structured them with dbt models into facts and dimensions, validated with PostgreSQL, and finally built a BI dashboard in Looker Studio. The goal was to create a scalable and analytics-ready data mart for business reporting.\n",
    " \n",
    "The project was executed with a focus on:\n",
    "- Data Warehousing (Snowflake) for scalable storage and compute.\n",
    "- Data Modeling (dbt) using a layered approach (staging ‚Üí marts ‚Üí fact/dim).\n",
    "- Business Intelligence (Google Looker Studio) for interactive dashboards and reporting.\n",
    "- Cross-platform validation (PostgreSQL) to demonstrate SQL interoperability.\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Problem Statement__ : \n",
    "\n",
    "Retail and e-commerce businesses generate millions of transactional records daily (orders, products, customers). Without a proper pipeline, these remain siloed and raw, limiting the ability to generate fast, reliable business insights.\n",
    "Traditional OLTP systems are not designed for analytics ‚Äî queries become slow, reporting inconsistent, and decision-making delayed.\n",
    "üëâ The need: a cloud-ready analytical Orders Mart that is scalable, reliable, and governed for enterprise reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Solution Overview__\n",
    "- Have designed and implemented an end-to-end analytical Orders Mart with the following architecture:\n",
    "- Data Warehousing (Snowflake) ‚Äì scalable storage + compute for raw and processed data. \n",
    "- Data Transformation (dbt) ‚Äì modular, testable SQL transformations from staging ‚Üí marts.\n",
    "- Star Schema Modeling ‚Äì fact (orders) + dimensions (customers, products, dates) for BI readiness.\n",
    "- Validation (PostgreSQL) ‚Äì replicated schema for hybrid/on-prem readiness.\n",
    "- Business Intelligence (Looker Studio) ‚Äì interactive dashboards for KPIs and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline ensures high-quality, analytics-ready data delivered with governance and scalability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Project Workflow__\n",
    "1. Raw Data Ingestion ‚Äì Loaded CSVs into Snowflake (customers_raw, orders_raw, products_raw).\n",
    "2. Validation ‚Äì Parallel ingestion into PostgreSQL to validate OLTP vs OLAP queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transformations with dbt ‚Äì\n",
    "- Sources ‚Üí staging (cleansing, normalization).\n",
    "- Staging ‚Üí marts (star schema).\n",
    "- Fact: fct_orders ; Dimensions: dim_customers, dim_products, dim_dates.\n",
    "- dbt tests for uniqueness, referential integrity, freshness.\n",
    "4. Documentation ‚Äì dbt lineage + catalog.json.\n",
    "5. Business Intelligence ‚Äì Looker Studio dashboard: sales trends, top products, customer insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Feature Engineering & Quality__\n",
    "- Star Schema optimized for analytics (fact + dimension separation).\n",
    "- dbt Tests (29/29 Passed): uniqueness, not-null, referential integrity.\n",
    "- Validation Scripts (PostgreSQL): row counts, null checks, duplicates, integrity checks. \n",
    "- Governance ‚Äì dbt docs + catalog.json ensure reproducibility & transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "__*Finished running 29 data tests in 0 hours 0 minutes and 12.19 seconds (12.19s)*__.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄúAll 29 data tests passed, which means my data is clean and trustworthy ‚Äî no duplicates, no missing keys, and all relationships between fact and dimension tables are valid.‚Äù\n",
    "- Keys are unique (no duplicate IDs). \n",
    "- Not null constraints hold true (all required fields populated).\n",
    "- Relationships are intact (foreign keys in fct_orders match valid dimension keys).\n",
    "- That‚Äôs a fully validated star schema with trustworthy data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__*14:26:45 Catalog written to E:\\orders_mart_dbt\\target\\catalog.json (.venv) PS E:\\orders_mart_dbt>*__ (*dbt docs generate*) \n",
    "That line means dbt just wrote the metadata catalog (catalog.json) into the target/ folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äúdbt generates a catalog.json file which contains metadata about all models, columns, and tests. This powers the dbt docs site so I can visualize the lineage graph and expose documentation to stakeholders.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "__5. Achievements__\n",
    "- Built a cloud-native Orders Mart in Snowflake with modular dbt transformations.\n",
    "- Achieved 100% data quality validation (all dbt + manual tests passed).\n",
    "- Delivered BI dashboards with sub-second query performance.\n",
    "- Showcased cross-platform validation (Snowflake ‚Üî PostgreSQL) for hybrid readiness.\n",
    "- Produced professional documentation, lineage graphs, and evidence of governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__6. Lessons Learned__\n",
    "- Loading via Snowflake stages is effective for CSV ‚Üí Snowflake ingestion in smaller-scale projects.\n",
    "- dbt enforces a best-practice framework: modular SQL, automated testing, and lineage visibility.\n",
    "- PostgreSQL served as a valuable practice ground for validation, but in production, a direct Postgres ‚Üí Snowflake migration could be implemented via connectors, ETL tools, or cloud pipelines.\n",
    "- Keeping BI logic minimal ensures strong governance and performance by pushing all heavy transformations into the warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "__7. Value & Scalability__\n",
    " This project demonstrates how raw transactional data can be transformed into reliable insights at scale:\n",
    "- Business Value ‚Äì faster, accurate sales + customer insights.\n",
    "- Scalability ‚Äì dbt + Snowflake architecture can handle millions of rows seamlessly.\n",
    "- Governance ‚Äì lineage + tests ensure data trustworthiness.\n",
    "- Hybrid Deployment ‚Äì same star schema works in both cloud (Snowflake) and on-prem (PostgreSQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "üöÄ Outcome: A reusable, enterprise-grade Orders Mart blueprint for analytics, reporting, and BI ‚Äî with proven governance and scalability."
