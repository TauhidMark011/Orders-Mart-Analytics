-- Fact table at the correct grain (one row per order_id per product).
-- Surrogate keys (customer_key, product_key) â€” ensures neat joins with dimensions.
-- Measures: quantity, unit_price, order_amount.
-- DBT tests: not_null, unique, relationships for referential integrity.
-- Materialized as table (important for large fact tables, avoids re-computation).
